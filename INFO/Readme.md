• Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.

• Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror

• Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98

• Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will
always be named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp.

• The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0.

• Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and
friend keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.

• Avoid memory leaks.

• From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox
Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated otherwise.

• You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding include guards. Otherwise, your grade will
be 0.

• You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don’t be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.
